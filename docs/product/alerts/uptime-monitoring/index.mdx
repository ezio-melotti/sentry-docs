Sentry's Uptime Monitoring allows you to ensure the availability and reliability of your web services effortlessly. Currently, uptime is automatically configured as a new alert for the most relevant URL detected in your organization. In future updates, you'll have the flexibility to add and monitor additional URLs.

## Uptime Check Criteria

Our uptime monitoring system verifies the availability of your URLs by performing GET requests at regular 5-minute intervals. For a URL to be considered up and running, the response must meet the following criteria:

1. **Successful Response (2xx Status Codes):** The URL must return an HTTP status code in the 200–299 range, indicating a successful request.
2. **Automatic Handling of Redirects (3xx Status Codes):** URLs returning an HTTP status code in the 300–399 range, indicating a redirect, will trigger Sentry to automatically follow the redirect and verify the final destination URL returns a successful response. This ensures that redirects don’t falsely trigger downtime alerts.
3. **Timeout Setting:** Each request has a timeout threshold of 10 seconds. If the server doesn't respond within this period, the check will be marked as a failure, indicating a potential downtime or performance issues.
4. **DNS Issue Detection:** Our monitoring also includes the detection of DNS resolution issues. If a DNS issue is detected, the check will be marked as a failure, allowing you to address the underlying connectivity problems.

## Notifications

An existing uptime alert continuously monitors the configured URL with the criteria defined above, and upon any failures, a new [uptime issue](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) is created with details of the failed check and related errors.

To receive notifications for a new downtime issue, [configure an issue alert](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/) that matches the issue's category as "uptime" with the chosen actions (such as sending an email, triggering Slack, etc.).
