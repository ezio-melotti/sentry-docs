## Verify Feature Eligibility

Uptime alerts are only available for organizations with early adopter features enabled, and that have relevant URLs matching our [auto-detection criteria](http://localhost:3000/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/automatic-detection/). Currently, organizations are limited to a single uptime alert.

## Verify Firewall Configuration

Some hosting platforms can block incoming requests from Sentry's Uptime Bot, falsely triggering uptime alerts. We recommend verifying your firewall configuration to ensure incoming requests from Sentry are allowed.

If you need to configure your firewall allowlist to include Sentry's Uptime Bot, we recommend checking against our `User-Agent` given our IP addresses can change without notice.

### User Agent

Our uptime check requests use the following `User-Agent`:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; SentryUptimeBot/1.0; +http://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/)
```

### IP addresses

See [IP Ranges](/security-legal-pii/security/ip-ranges/#uptime-monitoring) for a complete list of IP addresses used for uptime checks.

## Verify Issue Alerts Match Downtime Issues

Uptime alerts create downtime issues, if you are not receiving notifications when downtimes are detected, make sure you have properly [configured an issue alert](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/) that matches the issue's category as "uptime".
